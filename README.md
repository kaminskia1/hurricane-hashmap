# Hurricane Hashmap (CS220 Project)

## Objective
  - Implement a Hashmap utilizing both open-hashing and closed-hashing, then load names of family members from a file 
    and subsequently group them together by lastname.

## Usage
  - Upon running main, user is prompted with a console window. They can then opt to load a file (names.txt in /hurricane 
    directory) or load in names manually. Names will then be pushed to an active instance of the hashmap's implementation,
    and families will subsequently be automatically grouped.

## Import Syntax
  - Create a file named `names.txt` in `/hurricane`, and populate with data following the undermentioned syntax
```
<lastname> <firstname>
Doe John
Doe Jane
etc...
```
